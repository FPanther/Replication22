# Replication22

This repo is for the supplementary materials and experimental data for an experiment consisting of a Word Identification Task and a Wellformedness Rating Task on what non-Māori speaking New Zealanders know about Te Reo Māori. 

**Important note**: model `m6` is too large for github (125mb), and so it was compressed in order to be uploaded to this repo. Please unzip before you run the markdown file!
